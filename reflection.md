Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I consulted with Vivian Wei with using Scanner to read the next integer printed by the user. And I consulted with Yujie Gong about detecting the period in the user's input and remove it. I also discussed with Tina Chang about using equals or replacement while assigning the words with mirror words.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended the office hours on Thursday morning and consulted Professor Jordan with the structure of mirroring words.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Java needs more detailed instruction than python.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The ways of thinking in these two languages are quite similar, but the uses of grammer have some differences. I think having the effective way of thinking on a program is important, and we can find the use of language through searching or consulting with others.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think talking with other people about your ideas is effective on making your mind clear. Don't struggle on a single problem by spending too much time on it. I suggested to make an outline first and then gradually elaborate it.
